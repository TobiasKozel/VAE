# Public API
Here are the public includes for the Engine

## vae_pimpl.hpp
Contains the autogenerated vae::EnginePimpl Class which forwards all interactions to vae::core::Engine
Use the PIMPL-API if only the basic interaction with the engine is good enough.
No dependencies will be brought into your main project except for vae.hpp below.
This is probably mostly used for dynamic linking.

See example/pimpl/compiletime.cpp

## vae.hpp
Contains all the datatypes shared between the implementation and PIMPL-API.
